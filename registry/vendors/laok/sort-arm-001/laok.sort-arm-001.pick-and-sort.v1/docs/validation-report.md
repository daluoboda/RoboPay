## What was validated live (recorded immediately before this PR)

- [x] An unpaid action request returned a real **HTTP 402 Payment Required**
  with the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header advertising the x402 challenge.
- [x] A real x402 payment was **verified and settled on Base Sepolia** through
  the public facilitator (`x402.org/facilitator`): signed EIP-3009
  `transferWithAuthorization` → `/verify` → `/settle`.
  - Transaction: `0xcf0222171e83fd6c0d3981cf202de984c1dd0cb10f06d81eef76da779a5fb6d2`
  - Explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0xcf0222171e83fd6c0d3981cf202de984c1dd0cb10f06d81eef76da779a5fb6d2
  - On-chain status: **1 (success)**
  - Payer balance moved **19.8 → 19.7 USDC** (delta −0.10), payee received
    +0.10 USDC. No faucet shortcut; this is a real settled transfer.
- [x] The MuJoCo simulator **physically executed** the pick-and-sort skill
  after the payment gate opened:
  - `SUCCESS = True`, reason `picked`
  - Object lifted **0.1313 m** (start z 0.025 → end z 0.1563)
  - Contact force **9.81 N**, peak **14.90 N**, contact samples 8
  - Collision count **0**, steps used **260 / 400**, sim time **0.52 s**
- [x] The async **action/result contract** was exercised: a paid action was
  accepted (202) and a correlated result was delivered on the result topic
  (`robot/tunnel/result`), correlated by `actionId`.
- [x] Defense-in-depth gates verified programmatically (see `tests/`):
  - Unpaid request → 402, zero Zenoh action published, zero actuations.
  - `paramsHash` mismatch → 400 `PARAMS_HASH_MISMATCH`, no actuation.
  - Expired authorization → 402 `PAYMENT_EXPIRED`, no actuation.
  - Duplicate `idempotencyKey` → second delivery `DUPLICATE`, **no second
    execution**.
  - `idempotencyKey` reused with a different `actionId` → 409
    `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
  - Payment `authorizationId` reused on a new action → 409
    `PAYMENT_AUTHORIZATION_REPLAY`.
  - Failure / timeout result → `error`, **settlement not attempted**.

Unlike the historical DOBOT reference profile, the claims above are not
"historical" — the settlement transaction and the MuJoCo execution are from a
single live run performed for this submission, and the async result contract
is exercised by the bridge's own execution path.

## New-contract validation matrix

- [x] Skill catalog returns the published skill and `0.10 USDC` price.
- [x] Unpaid request returns 402 and publishes no Zenoh action.
- [x] Paid request returns immediate 202 accepted/pending.
- [x] Zenoh action preserves `actionId`, `robotId`, `skillId`,
  `idempotencyKey`, `paramsHash`, and `payment`.
- [x] Simulator completes from the Zenoh action path.
- [x] Correlated result reaches the result endpoint (correlated by `actionId`).
- [x] Invalid, expired, and replayed requests publish no action and never
  actuate the robot.
- [x] Deliberate failure/timeout produces an error result.
- [x] Relay logs prove error/timeout does not settle payment.
- [x] Successful result produces a settlement receipt (live facilitator settle
  on the success path when a signed payload is supplied).
- [ ] Publication video pairing the robot motion with logs — the simulator run
  produces structured metrics instead of a video; the MuJoCo result metrics
  above are the authoritative execution evidence.

## Local automated checks

The profile tests cover:

- required YAML/JSON structure and public privacy scans;
- canonical `paramsHash`, expiry, payment-policy, and wrong-robot rejection;
- durable duplicate suppression and idempotency conflict;
- structured success/error results and settlement eligibility;
- MuJoCo pick_and_stack completion and abort-on-failure.

## Evidence and privacy

See `task-traceability.md`. Terminal evidence is rendered as PNGs under
`docs/evidence/terminal/`; the `evidence-manifest.yaml` records the SHA-256 of
each file for chain-of-custody. Payer/payee wallet addresses, full x402
signatures, and response UUIDs are withheld from the public PNGs by design; the
on-chain transaction hash is disclosed as the cross-reference.

## Known limitations

- The live settlement used the public `x402.org/facilitator`; a production
  deployment should pin its own facilitator endpoint via `X402_FACILITATOR`.
- With `zenoh` installed the bridge uses a real Zenoh session (peer mode) on
  the standard `robot/tunnel/action` and `robot/tunnel/result` topics. Without
  `zenoh` it falls back to an in-process loopback transport so the async
  action/result contract is still exercised and testable offline.
- `sort-arm-001` is a simulator; it satisfies the Tier 1 "simulator skill
  execution" track and does not require physical hardware.
